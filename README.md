# Livetrack Hub

**Livetrack Hub** is a real-time location display system built for shared visibility and passive awareness in homes or organizations. Designed to run on a Raspberry Pi and show on a dedicated screen, it provides an always-on dashboard that shows who's home, away, or en route — no phone unlocking or app-checking needed.

## Key Features

### Centralized Shared Monitoring

- Always-on display of members' real-time presence.
- No need for each user to check a phone or open an app.
- Perfect for busy or shared living environments where coordination is key.

### Geofencing at a Glance

- Uses simple true/false logic to determine whether users are home or away.
- Functions similarly to a digital wall clock — passive, quick-reference visibility.

### Location History

- In addition to showing real-time presence, **Livetrack Hub** supports the potential for logging and displaying **location history** over time. This feature offers useful insights into user movement patterns, including:
  - When a person left or arrived at home.
  - Daily routines, such as commuting to work or school.
  - Historical confirmation of presence for safety or accountability.

### Future-Proof Platform

- Foundation for further integration and automation, such as:
  - Smart home device control (lights, locks, thermostat)
  - Safety alerts and routine monitoring
  - Multi-location support
  - Custom notifications (e.g. "Child not home by 4 PM")

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Home and Family Tracking Hub
- Parents can check if children have arrived home from school.
- Partners can verify if the other person is home before calling or texting.
- Elderly care: confirm presence without phone interaction.
- Great for roommates or households with multiple residents.

### 2. Corporate Office Oversight
- Live presence tracking for in-office vs. remote employees.
- Lobby/reception dashboards for quick visitor assistance.
- Team visibility for coordination on in-person meetings or breaks.

### 3. Group Homes and Assisted Living
- Monitor when residents have left or returned.
- Staff can quickly check if anyone is missing before lockdowns or emergencies.
- Peace of mind for families and caregivers alike.

### 4. School or Campus Applications
- Dormitory or residence hall presence boards.
- Classroom-level visibility for student attendance.
- RAs or dorm monitors can quickly verify who’s around.

### 5. Event and Group Tracking
- Hackathons, LAN parties, and clubs: live tracking of participants.
- Camps or retreats: quickly see which groups are checked in or out.
- After-school programs or youth centers: non-invasive child pickup visibility.

### 6. Industrial or Workshop Settings
- Visibility into whether machine operators or safety officers are present.
- Easy reference in environments where phones are discouraged.
- Safety checks during evacuations or maintenance shifts.
