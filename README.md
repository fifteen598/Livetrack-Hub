## Here are some reasons our project is beneficial in comparison to any phone app: 

### 1. It's Centralized and Incorporates Shared Monitoring:
We offer a real-time 24/7 display that is visible to anyone within the household without needing to pull out your phone *(i.e. your hands are full)*. This is especially useful in busy households or shared living environments where it's important to know the whereabouts of family members without having to ask or constantly check in on them.

### 2. Geofencing:
Uses simple true false (boolean) functionality to display whether a user is home or away. This is valuable in the context of our project because all it takes is a quick glance to know whether or not somebody is home or not. This has a more passive but also constant utility, like knowing when someone has returned home from work or left for school, without needing to actively track them.

> **KEY: The persistent display acts as a quick glance system, similar to how you might look at a wall clock to check the time. Imagine needing to set everything in your hands down, unlock your phone, navigate to an app on that phone, waiting for that app to load, just to check the time.**

### 3. Familial Convenience:
This system can be particularly more effective in homes with children, elderly, disabled, or just multiple people. Our system can be set up in a living room or central common area, making it easier and more accessible to check the general whereabouts of family members. For example, 
- Parents can check if their children have arrived at school or home at quick glance without engaging in heavy context-switching.
- Grandparents with little technological knowledge can easily monitor their grandchildrens' locations, eliminating the obstacle of smartphone navigation.

### 4. Future Potential for Expansions:
Our project also creates a foundation for future automation and safety features. With further developments, we could automate other systems (like lighting, smart home device integration, or notifications/alerts) based on user data.
